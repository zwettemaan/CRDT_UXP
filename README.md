# Creative Developer Tools for UXP

## What it does

Creative Developer Tools is a growing suite of tools aimed at script and plug-in developers for the Adobe Creative Cloud eco-system.

Currently, it is at an alpha stage: the feature set is not frozen, and new features are added regularly.

The first releases are meant to be functional and useful.

For information on the feature set:

## How it works

This works by way of a daemon. Launching the daemon will start an HTTPS server on https://localhost.tgrg.net

This DNS name resolves to 127.0.0.1

Before you can start the daemon you need a valid license. See further below for info on how to obtain a free trial license.
